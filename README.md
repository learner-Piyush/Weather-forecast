# Weather-forecast
This is my fully functional weather forecast website. It consists of HTML file which is essential for structure, CSS file for design and JS file for functionality.
I made this functional by calling an API from Open Weather.

In this project you have to enter your city name and it will call the API from Open Weather who has weather data and then it will show you the data.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

And yeah I have added a icon.

Let me know if you like the design and experience as well
